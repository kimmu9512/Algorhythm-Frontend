## Algorhythm

Algorhythm is a full-stack application designed to enhance the coding practice experience by providing users with a platform to solve LeetCode-like questions, track their progress, and receive personalized question recommendations. Users benefit from tailored suggestions that reinforce memory retention rather than rote learning. Repetition intervals are carefully selected to prevent users from memorizing specific algorithms, focusing instead on overarching techniques and skills required to approach and solve problems. By solving all the 'Explore' questions daily, users can effectively hone their problem-solving abilities.
